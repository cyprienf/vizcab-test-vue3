> :warning: **Don't forget to launch backend :)**

Launch the test

```bash
npm run tests
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Test the pagination method and add component tests with Vue Test Utils
- [ ] Enhance CSS (variables, components, link underlining)
- [ ] Finish BuildingDetails view
- [ ] Add Pinia for state management, so you don't have to call the backend route every time you retrieve building info
- [ ] Improve code formatting with prettier and eslint (import, typing...)
- [ ] Variabilize certain values (backend base url, number of buildings per page, etc.)
